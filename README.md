# GuitarWaveSimulation
Using addition of sine and cosine waves to create a visually creative, yet loose, simulation of a sound wave. 

**Details**

This sketch aims to create a visual and interactive representation of a sound wave. When the mouse is clicked the sound will
stop and so will the wave, and when the mouse is clicked again the both sound and the wave will resume. If the mouse is
clicked and dragged, the 'X' position of the mouse will determine the speed with which the wave travels as well as the rate
at which the sound will play pack. The aim was to mimick the audible change of frequency in the visual aspect.

Example of the sketch running found at this link: https://vimeo.com/419261647 

**Instruction**

For this skecth to run properly an audio file needs to be downloaded and placed in the "data" folder with the sketch, I have
provided the audio file I used but any audio file can be used. Once the sketch is ready to be run, and the audio file is in
place, just run the program and experiment with different playback rates.
